	<!-- <h2>Fact File</h2> -->
	<p>Five hundred years ago, Leonardo da Vinci could be a painter, engineer, musician, and scientist. One hundred years ago, it is said that a physician might have reasonably expected to know everything in the field of medicine. Today, a typical primary care doctor must stay abreast of approximately 10,000 diseases and syndromes, 3,000 medications, and 1,100 laboratory tests. Research librarians estimate that a physician in just one speciality, epidemiology, needs 21 hours of study per day just to stay current. Faced with this flood of medical information, clinicians routinely fall behind, despite specialization and sub-specialization. <em></em> <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/" title="The Fourth Paradigm - Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery">The Fourth  Paradigm</a></p>
