2. Ask for the current year and the user’s age, responding with their year of birth.
3. Ask the user for their height in metres, and respond with the same in feet and inches.
4. Tell the user that it’s going to calculate their ‘Star Wars name’.
o Ask for their mother’s first name.
o Ask for the name of the city closest to their place of birth.
o Respond with their Star Wars name.
Your Star Wars first name consists of the first three letters of your surname followed by the first 2
