The function in Line 77 of Main.py Opens report.py

When the button Sales Report is clicked it should run the report.py file but it doesnt

Reason for error: ImportError: No module named PyQt4

when report.py is run alone. It works perfectly but when run from Main it generates this error

Which Puzzles me because PyQt4 runs perfectly when report.py is run alone
