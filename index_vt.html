<p><strong>Lighton Phiri</strong> is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where he also received his B.S. degree.  As a member of the Digital Library Research Laboratory, he explores and investigates areas of semantic digital libraries based on ontology engineering, classification methodologies with domain ontologies, digital library curriculum development, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Visual Analytics.  Other interests include social media, Human Information Processing, Learning Sciences, and studies about subconscious and reflex.</p>

<p>Currently he is working on topic identification approaches and disaster domain ontology developments as part of his doctoral study. In the past, he worked with researchers in the Library and Information Sciences to develop a unified curriculum for digital library education. Various publications had been produced from this project. Through other collaborative studies, he contributed in developing a Visual Analytics tool which was presented in the VAST 2010 conference.  He also presented studies of collaborative behaviors when multiple people work together on a shared drawing space in CSCW 2010.</p>
